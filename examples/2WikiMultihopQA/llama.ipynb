      "\" Mulder and Scully\" is a song by Catatonia, released as a single from their 1998 album,\" International Velvet\". The song makes direct reference to fictional FBI special agents Fox Mulder( David Duchovny) and Dana Scully( Gillian Anderson), the two main characters of the popular sci -fi TV series\" The X- Files\" who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X- Files. In an interview Cerys Matthews, co-writer of the song, explained that while she was not a serious fan of the show, the basic premise of the series matched the concept of what she was trying to express. \" Mulder and Scully\" was released as the second single from the band's album\" International Velvet\". Originally, it was supposed to be the first single but was delayed due to circumstances beyond the band's control. The song was Catatonia's first single in the United States. \" Mulder and Scully\" became the group's break- out hit and received a mixed to positive from the music press; many critics felt that, musically, the song was well played, but that the track's pop culture references were out of place. The song reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, making it Catatonia's highest- charting UK song. It also became a hit in Iceland, reaching number two, and in Ireland, where it peaked at number 17. A music video was released that featured the band performing the track while Mulder and Scully, played by look- alikes, search the concert venue with torches.\n",

      "Syzygy (The X-Files)\n",
      "\" Syzygy\" is the thirteenth episode of the third season of the science fiction television series\" The X- Files\". The episode first aired in the United States on January 26, 1996, on Fox. It was written by series creator Chris Carter and directed by Rob Bowman. The episode is a\" Monster- of- the- Week\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \" Syzygy\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.8, being watched by 16.04 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews, with many critics and fans upset by the negative portrayal of Mulder and Scully. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder( David Duchovny) and Dana Scully( Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X- Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the murders of high school students in a small town where everyone is acting strangely. They discover that two teens are responsible, due to a rare planetary alignment that affects their behavior. The episode's title refers to an astronomical alignment of three celestial objects, usually the sun, the Earth, and a moon or planet. Mulder and Scully's behavior in the episode was written specifically by Carter to alert the show's audience that Mulder and Scully would not become a romantic partnership. In addition, the episode contained various fan in- jokes, such as Scully getting upset because Mulder is always the driver, which was inspired by nitpicking from fans. \n",
