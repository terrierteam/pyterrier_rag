# PyTerrier RAG

PyTerrier-RAG is an extension for [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) that makes it easier to produce retrieval augmented generation pipelines. PyTerrier-RAG supports:
1. Easy access to common QA datasets
2. Pre-built indices for common corpora
3. Popular reader models, such as Fusion-in-Decoder, LLama
4. Evaluation measures

As well as access to all of the retrievers (sparse, learned sparse and dense) and rerankers (from MonoT5 to RankGPT) accessible through the wider [PyTerrier ecosystem](https://pyterrier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
