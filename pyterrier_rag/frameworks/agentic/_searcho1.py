ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """**Task Instruction:**
You are tasked with reading and analyzing web pages based on the following inputs: **Previous Reasoning Steps**, **Current Search Query**, and **Searched Web Pages**. 
Your objective is to extract relevant and helpful information for **Current Search Query** from the **Searched Web Pages** and seamlessly integrate this information into the **Previous Reasoning Steps** to continue reasoning for the original question.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Analyze the Searched Web Pages:**
- Carefully review the content of each searched web page.
- Identify factual information that is relevant to the **Current Search Query** and can aid in the reasoning process for the original question.

2. **Extract Relevant Information:**
- Select the information from the Searched Web Pages that directly contributes to advancing the **Previous Reasoning Steps**.
- Ensure that the extracted information is accurate and relevant.

3. **Output Format:**
- **If the web pages provide helpful information for current search query:** Present the information beginning with `**Final Information**` as shown below.
**Final Information**

[Helpful information]

- **If the web pages do not provide any helpful information for current search query:** Output the following text.

**Final Information**

No helpful information found.

**Inputs:**
- **Previous Reasoning Steps:**  
{prev_reasoning}

- **Current Search Query:**  
{search_query}

- **Searched Web Pages:**  
{documents}

Now you should analyze each web page and find helpful information based on the current search query "{search_query}" and previous reasoning steps.
